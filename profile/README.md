# We need your help
With MycroftAI reduced to a skeleton crew, and the transfer of most development operations to Neon, we've decided to become a nonprofit association under Dutch law. OpenVoiceOS will be registered as OpenVoiceOS V.z.w. (Dutch: "Vereninging zonder winstoogmerk", a nonprofit association, as distinguished from a foundation.) The association will support the OVOS community in legal and financial matters by securing donations of cash, hardware, and other relevant aid. These donations will be used to facilitate software development, promotion, and support.

To establish the association and equip it with a positive balance for ongoing expenses, we have determined that we need to raise €3033. We’re deeply grateful for any support. You can chip in at our GoFundMe campaign;

Sharing is caring and is very much appreciated. Please help us spread the word.

# OpenVoiceOS
OpenVoiceOS is a free and open-source personal assistant and smart speaker that offers a powerful and flexible alternative to proprietary solutions like Amazon Echo and Google Home. At the same time, it is also an open-source virtual assistant platform that enables developers and organizations to create custom voice-controlled applications. With its cutting-edge technology and user-friendly design, OpenVoiceOS is revolutionizing the way we interact with technology.

The platform provides a comprehensive suite of features that makes it easy to deploy voice-based applications for a wide range of use cases, including home automation, entertainment, education, and more. With natural language processing, multi-device compatibility, a customizable UI, robust APIs, and a focus on privacy and security, OpenVoiceOS delivers a highly responsive and accurate experience for users.

In addition to its voice capabilities, OpenVoiceOS also features a touch-screen GUI made using QT and the KDE frameworks, providing an intuitive and user-friendly interface. And with its open-source nature, anyone with technical skills can contribute to the platform and help shape its future.

## Why OpenVoiceOS
OpenVoiceOS is the perfect choice for anyone who wants a personal assistant and smart speaker that gives them complete control over their data and the ability to customize their experience. Here are some of the key features that set OpenVoiceOS apart from other smart speakers on the market:

*Multi-device compatibility:* OpenVoiceOS can be integrated with a wide range of devices, including smart speakers, smartphones, laptops and televisions making it easy for you to access and control your virtual assistant no matter where you are.

*Robust & Modular:* OpenVoiceOS leverages the power of skills and plugins to create a robust and modular virtual assistant platform, offering unparalleled customization and extension capabilities.

*Fully Offline:* While the default speech-to-text (STT) engine currently requires an internet connection, some self-hosted, offline options are available. This means that OpenVoiceOS can run without the use of any online services, so you don’t have to rely on anyone keeping their servers up.

*Privacy and security:* OpenVoiceOS is designed with privacy and security in mind. Whether you’re concerned about the security of your personal information or the privacy of your voice commands, OpenVoiceOS provides peace of mind.

Whether you prefer voice commands or a more traditional touch interface, OpenVoiceOS has you covered, and the option to run the platform fully offline gives you complete control over your data and ensures that your information is never shared with third parties. With its powerful and flexible features, OpenVoiceOS is the ideal choice for anyone who wants a voice-controlled virtual assistant and smart speaker that offers complete control and customization.
